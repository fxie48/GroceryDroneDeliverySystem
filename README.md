# Grocery Drone Delivery System
In this project, we blueprinted and implemented a MySQL relational database to store information about users, items, and orders for a Grocery Drone Delivery System by following a database design methodology. 

## Phase I 
In Phase I, we created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on given project requirements.

## Phase II
In Phase II, we translated the the ERD into the relational schema shown below. It lists the numerous tables and relationships needed to store the different aspects of the system. Additionally, we created the tables and uploaded a provided dataset into the tables. The code can be found in the file named _Phase II - Schema Creation.sql_

## Phase III 
Finally in Phase III, we wrote SQL create, view, filter, and modify stored procedures needed to support an application. The code can be found in the file named _Phase III - shell.sql_.
