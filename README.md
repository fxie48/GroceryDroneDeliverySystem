# GroceryDroneDeliverySystem
We designed a database to store information about users, items, and orders within a Grocery Drone Delivery System. Our schema can be viewed in the link under Phase II. It contains numerous tables to store the different aspects of the system we needed. After creating a blueprint of our database in Phases I and II of the project, we started querying from it to retrieve specific information.

## Phase I
